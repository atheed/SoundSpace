##Process

**Describe your process**

The group organizes itself by following the rough work division outlines they discussed previously: members who began putting together the server functionality and back-end continue with back-end tasks, while people who expressed their interest in the front end and UI/UX design generate and tackle tasks in their domain. Each member initiates a talk with others when they need tools or functionality necessary for their parts, under the second person's domain.
The group has also gathered for some group development sessions unlike before, which has been helpful for producing faster work.

**Tools**

The primary communication tool continues to be Slack. Group members pose questions and suggestions on Slack for different tasks and problems that needs solving, and a member takes on the solution after collaboration. Hangout calls were also used with screen-share tools to walk other members through the code if there was any confusion over different snippets. Beyond these tools, Issues have been used more frequently as well.

**Change in process**

The group has followed a slightly different approach from the process that was defined in Phase 2. One particular difference was the lack of scrum meetings. There was a shift towards leaving updates on work taken on and work done on the Slack channel, with member-to-member messages sent for clarifying issues in coupled areas of code.

A second version of a backlog was used to identify more specific tasks, a document that was kept up to date with different design decisions and cut-off features for the project. It can be found in this phase's documents folder or [here](https://github.com/csc301-fall-2015/project-team5-L0101/blob/master/doc/phase3/backlog.md).

One group development session and meeting was conducted on 11/19 in BA3200. For the first 2 hours, back-end and server functionality were worked on, adaptation to mongodb database rather than using JSON files were discussed. Design changes for merging room/playlist functionality was made. For the last three hours, front-end and GUI was worked on, hmtl files were merged, and physical design aspects of the GUI was discussed along with changing the UX design to eliminate unnecessary extra steps users must go through to navigate the app.

Issues were used more frequently this time, with much more specific written tasks for each Issue. Issues opened in this Phase can be seen [here](https://github.com/csc301-fall-2015/project-team5-L0101/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+created%3A%3E2015-11-18+) with closed issues [here](https://github.com/csc301-fall-2015/project-team5-L0101/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+created%3A%3E2015-11-18+is%3Aclosed). Some individual progress can be seen here in form of issues as well.

Another change has been the usage of individual Issues for task sizing and burndown chart. Since each Issue was highly specific and described one task, burndown chart has been generated on the Issue numbers created. The current group burndown chart, as of 11/22 5:47pm can be found [here](http://i.imgur.com/QuXhyCT.png)

**Rationale**

The primary decision about the organization was the abandonment of the daily scrum meetings. Each member being busy with different courses, having different schedules and available working time on the project, meetings were not very fruitful in terms of putting each person on the spot for their previously taken responsibilities. Instead, reporting to Slack channel in everyone's own time were more fruitful.

More emphasis on issues were placed since the group previously had difficulties recording what each person did with tangible proof.
