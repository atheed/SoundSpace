# SoundSpace
Ever been at a party/in a car with colleagues/just hanging out with friends, and nobody got to listen to the music they wanted? Then look no further!

SoundSpace is a social music-organization app that allows users to upvote and downvote songs in user-created playlists, thus impacting the priority of each song in the queued playlist. The more upvotes a song has, the higher its priority! And the more downvotes a song has, well... then clearly no one wants to listen to it. 

Never worry about who wants to play what music ever again; with SoundSpace, everyone gets their say!
